Run automatic change detections and get notified on changes of your website. Or run manual change detections before and after updates.

== Description ==

With  WebChangeDetector you can track changes on every page of your WP website. When something changes on your website,
you get an email with an image, where the differences are marked. You will also see images with the two compared versions
to see better what changed.

You can use WebChangeDetector in two different ways:
1. Update Change Detection
Take screenshots before and after updating your website and detect changes. This way you see immediately if something
broke and you can fix it.
2. Auto Change Detection
Automatically detect changes on your website in a certain interval. If something changes on your website, you will get an email
to review the changes. All changes of your page are marked in a screenshot.

Here a few features of WebChangeDetector:
*   Set intervals for auto change detections from 1 hour up to 24 hours.
*   Get change detections for mobile and desktop screen sizes
*   Alert email with direct link to see the changes
*   Start update change detection to see changes before and after updates
