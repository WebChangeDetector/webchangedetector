Run automatic change detections and get notified on changes of your website. Or run manual change detections before and after updates.

== Description ==

Quite often WP website break for many different reasons. And also quite often we don't realize it until a client
tells us that something is wrong. And then we are embarrassed and don't look professional.

With the WebChangeDetector you can track changes on every page of your WP website. When something changes on your website,
you get an email with an image, where the differences are marked. You will also see images with the two compared versions
to see better what changed.

Here a few features of WebChangeDetector:
*   Set intervals for auto change detections from 1 hour up to 24 hours.
*   Get change detections for mobile and desktop screen sizes
*   Alert email with direct link to see the changes
*   Start update change detection to see changes before and after updates
