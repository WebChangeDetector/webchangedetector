With WebChangeDetector you can find any difference on your website

*   after installing updates,
*   after installing new plugins,
*   after pagespeed optimization,
*   after CSS changes or
*   any other customization on your WordPress website.

See all differences **highlighted in a new screenshot** to easily compare your website before and after the changes.
