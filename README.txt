== Description ==
**The #1 Change Detector For WordPress**

With WebChangeDetector you can check your website **before and after updates , installing new plugins, pagespeed optimization or doing other customisations like CSS changes**. See all differences **marked in a screenshot**.
Compare your website before and after the changes. We mark changes in a new screenshot. Next to the compare screenshot you can compare the before and after screenshot in a slider.
Now you can make sure your website looks the way you want after changes – and fix anything that does not, before your visitors do.

*   **Save troubles** with your visitors by letting us check your website after updates – for desktop and mobile screen sizes.
*   **Save time** with checking all pages yourself after some changes.
*   **Don’t miss sales** because of overlooking issues on your site.

You can not only track changes manually. The Auto Change Detection enables you to automatically track changes on every page on your WordPress site. If something changes, we will send you a notification so you can make sure everything looks at it should.

*   Start for free with **50 change detections per month**.
*   Run a change detection to see changes before and after updates at your website.
*   Set **automatic trackings** in intervals, from 1 hour up to 24 hours.
*   Check **desktop and mobile** screen sizes.
*   Receive an **email alerts** for change detections and check the changes.
*   Send only alert emails when changes above the threshold settings are detected.
*   **Share the change detection link** with your web designer to fix issues.
