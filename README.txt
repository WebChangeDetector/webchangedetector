Check your website after updates to see if something broke. Check your website automatically in
intervals and get notified about any change.

== Description ==
**Make sure your website looks good after updates and other changes**

With WebChangeDetector you can check your website **before and after updates , installing new plugins or doing other customisations like CSS changes**. See all differences **marked in a screenshot**.

Now you can make sure your updates look the way you want them to – and fix anything that does not, before your visitors do.

*   **Save troubles** with your visitors by letting us check your website after updates – for desktop and mobile.
*   **Save time** with checking all pages yourself after some changes.
*   **Don’t miss sales** because of overlooking issues on your site.

Track automatically changes on every page on your WordPress site. If something changes, we will send you a notification so you can make sure everything looks at it should.

*   Start for free with **50 change detections per month**.
*   Run a change detection to see changes before and after making an update to your website.
*   Set **automatic trackings** with intervals, from 1 hour up to 24 hours.
*   Check **desktop and mobile** screens.
*   Receive an **email alert** for change detections with a direct link to see the changes.
*   **Share the change detection link** with you Webdesigner to fix issues.
