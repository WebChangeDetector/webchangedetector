        Compare your website by taking and comparing screenshots before and after updates.
        You can see the exact difference between the screenshots in the Change Detections.

    <h3>Step by step</h3>
    <p>The wizard takes you step by step through the process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Select the URLs and screen sizes (desktop and / or mobile) you want to check before and after the updates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create the pre-update screenshots. While the screenshots are in progress, you can leave the page and come
            back later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make updates or other changes on your website.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create the post-update screenshots and compare them to the pre-update screenshots to see differences.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check the Change Detections for differences between the pre- and post-update screenshots.
        </li>
        <li>
            If something broke during the update, you will see it now and you can fix it. To verify the fix, you can start the
            Change Detection again. The new post-update screenshots will be compared against the pre-update screenshots.
        </li>
    </ol>
