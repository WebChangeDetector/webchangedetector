/**
 * REFACTORED VERSION OF WebChangeDetector_Autoupdates
 * 
 * This class has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
 * The complex wp_maybe_auto_update method has been broken down into smaller,
 * focused methods that each handle a specific aspect of the auto-update process.
 * 
 * Key improvements:
 * - Single responsibility principle: Each method has one clear purpose
 * - Better method naming: Methods clearly describe what they do
 * - Improved error handling: Consistent error checking and logging
 * - Easier testing: Smaller methods are easier to test individually
 * - Better documentation: Each method is properly documented
 * 
 * The logic remains the same, but the code is now much more maintainable.
