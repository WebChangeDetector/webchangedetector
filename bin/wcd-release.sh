# wcd-release.sh - cut a WebChange Detector plugin release.
#
# Bumps the plugin version header (and, for stable releases only, the
# "Stable tag" in README.txt), commits, tags and pushes. The GitHub Actions
# workflow .github/workflows/release.yml takes over from the tag push and
# builds/publishes the distribution zip.
#
# This script NEVER touches the wordpress.org SVN checkout (wp-repo-plugin/).
#
# Usage: ./bin/wcd-release.sh                   (interactive menu)
#        ./bin/wcd-release.sh <version> [--dry-run] [--yes]
#        ./bin/wcd-release.sh --next    [--dry-run] [--yes]
#
#   <version>   e.g. 4.4.0 or 4.4.0-beta.1
#   --next      derive the version from the current "Version:" header by
#               incrementing its pre-release counter (4.4.0-beta.1 ->
#               4.4.0-beta.2); mutually exclusive with <version>
#   --dry-run   validate and report only; changes nothing
#   --yes       skip the interactive confirmation
#
# With no version and no --next the script asks what to release (next
# pre-release / final / custom). That menu needs a terminal, so it is skipped
# for --yes and for a non-tty stdin; those stay a usage error, because an
# unattended run must never have its version guessed for it.
#
# Portability note: this runs on macOS (BSD userland). No `grep -P`, and no
# in-place `sed -i` (BSD requires a backup suffix, GNU forbids an empty one),
# so rewrites go through a temp file.

# No `pipefail` on purpose: `<cmd> | head -n1` makes the left side die with
# SIGPIPE, which pipefail would turn into a spurious script abort.

Usage: ./bin/wcd-release.sh                   (interactive menu)
       ./bin/wcd-release.sh <version> [--dry-run] [--yes]
       ./bin/wcd-release.sh --next    [--dry-run] [--yes]

  (no args)   Ask what to release: next pre-release, final release, or a
              custom version. Needs a terminal; not available with --yes.
  <version>   Semantic version, optionally with a pre-release suffix.
              Examples: 4.4.0, 4.4.0-beta.1, 4.4.0-rc.2
  --next      Derive the version from the current 'Version:' header by
              incrementing its pre-release counter (4.4.0-beta.1 ->
              4.4.0-beta.2, 4.4.0-beta.9 -> 4.4.0-beta.10). The current
              version must itself be a pre-release; a stable one is rejected
              because the intended next version would be ambiguous.
              Cannot be combined with <version>.
  --dry-run   Validate and report only. Changes no files, no git state.
  --yes       Skip the interactive confirmation prompt.

Run it without arguments and pick from the menu. --next and an explicit
version are the non-interactive forms, for scripting and unattended runs.

Recovery
--------

--------

them. Do NOT re-run this script for ${NEW_VERSION}. Push the existing state by
