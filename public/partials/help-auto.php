		<p>
			To get started, select the webpages, which interval to check, the time to start the interval, and which email
			address to send alerts to when a change is detected. Note that you can always create another group with
			different settings, with the same or other webpages.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we will automatically detect changes according to your settings, and if we notice a difference, you will
			receive an email with a link to the compared versions.

			<strong>Remove from group</strong><br>
			When removing an webpage from a group, the settings for CSS and selected devices will be deleted.

			If you want to delete an webpage permanently, you can do so in
			<a href="/webchangedetector/?tab=manage-urls">Manage webpages</a>. Note that change detections are
